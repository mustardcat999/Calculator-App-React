# Simple Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app built using React that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations. You can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find powers between two operands.

## Getting Started

To run this calculator app locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
#git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

#cd calculator-app

3. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:

npm install
# or
yarn install

4. Start the development server:

npm start
# or
yarn start

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to use the calculator app.

##Features
Input area to display the current and previous operands.
Buttons for digits (0-9) and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^).
AC button to clear all input.
DEL button to delete the last digit.
= button to evaluate the current expression.

##How It Works
The calculator app uses React's useReducer hook to manage the state of the calculator. The reducer function handles different actions such as adding digits, choosing operations, evaluating the expression, and more. The arithmetic operations are performed using the evaluate function.
